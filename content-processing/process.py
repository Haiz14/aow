"""
Processes an original txt document to json.

This script reads a text file named 'orig.txt', parses its content based on
pre-defined chapter and content patterns, and writes the structured data
into a JSON file named 'output.json'.

Input File Pattern ('./orig.txt'):
- Chapters are denoted by a Roman numeral (I to XIII) followed by a name.
  Example: I. Chapter One
- Each chapter contains numbered line with a pragraph or two of text followed by next number
  Example:   1. This is a line of text.
  Lime 2 of line 1
  2. New line
- The content ends with "THE END", followed by a separator line of hyphens,
  and then copyright information.
